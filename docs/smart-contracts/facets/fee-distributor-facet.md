- **Fee Receivers**: Array of addresses that receive fee distributions
- **Fee Weights**: Corresponding weights for each receiver

### Storage Pattern
Uses diamond storage pattern via [`FeeDistributorLib`](../libraries/fee-distributor-lib.md):
- Prevents storage collisions in diamond architecture
- Efficient storage of fee configuration
- Persistent settings across contract upgrades

## Core Functions

### Initialization Functions

#### `initializeFeeDistributor()`
```solidity
function initializeFeeDistributor(
    address _distributionToken,
    uint256 _totalWeightBasis
) external onlyOwner
```

**Purpose**: Initializes the fee distributor with token and weight basis configuration.

**Parameters**:
- `_distributionToken` (address): ERC20 token address for fee distributions
- `_totalWeightBasis` (uint256): Total weight basis for calculations (e.g., 10000)

**Access Control**: Owner only

**Validation**:
- Distribution token cannot be zero address
- Total weight basis must be greater than zero
- Can only be called once during deployment

**Process**:
1. Validates input parameters
2. Initializes fee distributor storage
3. Sets distribution token and weight basis
4. Emits FeeDistributorInitialized event

**Events**: `FeeDistributorInitialized(distributionToken, totalWeightBasis)`

**Example Usage**:
```solidity
// Initialize with USDC and basis points (10000)
IFeeDistributor(diamond).initializeFeeDistributor(
    usdcAddress,
    10000  // 10000 basis points = 100%
);
```

**Error Conditions**:
- `"FeeDistributor: Distribution token cannot be zero address"` - Invalid token address
- Already initialized error from library

---

### Configuration Functions

#### `setFeeReceivers()`
```solidity
function setFeeReceivers(
    address[] calldata _feeReceivers,
    uint256[] calldata _feeWeights
) external override onlyOwner
```

**Purpose**: Configures the addresses and weights for fee distribution.

**Parameters**:
- `_feeReceivers` (address[]): Array of addresses to receive fees
- `_feeWeights` (uint256[]): Array of weights corresponding to each receiver

**Access Control**: Owner only

**Validation**:
- Arrays must have equal length
- No zero addresses in receivers
- Weights must be greater than zero
- Total weights should not exceed weight basis

**Process**:
1. Validates input arrays
2. Updates fee receiver configuration
3. Stores receivers and weights
4. Emits FeeReceiversSet event

**Events**: `FeeReceiversSet(receivers, weights)`

**Example Usage**:
```solidity
// Set up fee distribution: 70% to treasury, 20% to team, 10% to marketing
address[] memory receivers = new address[](3);
receivers[0] = treasuryAddress;
receivers[1] = teamAddress;
receivers[2] = marketingAddress;

uint256[] memory weights = new uint256[](3);
weights[0] = 7000;  // 70%
weights[1] = 2000;  // 20%
weights[2] = 1000;  // 10%

IFeeDistributor(diamond).setFeeReceivers(receivers, weights);
```

**Weight Calculation Example**:
```solidity
// With totalWeightBasis = 10000
// Treasury: 7000/10000 = 70%
// Team: 2000/10000 = 20%
// Marketing: 1000/10000 = 10%
```

### Query Functions

#### `getFeeReceivers()`
```solidity
function getFeeReceivers() external view override returns (
    address[] memory feeReceivers,
    uint256[] memory feeWeights
)
```

**Purpose**: Returns the current fee receiver configuration.

**Returns**:
- `feeReceivers` (address[]): Array of fee recipient addresses
- `feeWeights` (uint256[]): Array of corresponding weights

**Example Usage**:
```solidity
(address[] memory receivers, uint256[] memory weights) = 
    IFeeDistributor(diamond).getFeeReceivers();

for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers.length; i++) {
    console.log("Receiver:", receivers[i]);
    console.log("Weight:", weights[i]);
}
```

---

#### `calculateAmounts()`
```solidity
function calculateAmounts(uint256 principalAmount) external view override returns (
    uint256 adjustedAmount,
    uint256[] memory feeAmounts
)
```

**Purpose**: Calculates fee distribution amounts without executing transfers.

**Parameters**:
- `principalAmount` (uint256): Total amount before fee deduction

**Returns**:
- `adjustedAmount` (uint256): Principal amount after deducting fees
- `feeAmounts` (uint256[]): Individual fee amounts for each receiver

**Example Usage**:
```solidity
// Calculate fees for a $1000 transaction
uint256 totalAmount = 1000 * 10**6; // 1000 USDC (6 decimals)

(uint256 adjustedAmount, uint256[] memory feeAmounts) = 
    IFeeDistributor(diamond).calculateAmounts(totalAmount);

console.log("Amount after fees:", adjustedAmount);
console.log("Treasury fee:", feeAmounts[0]);
console.log("Team fee:", feeAmounts[1]);
console.log("Marketing fee:", feeAmounts[2]);
```

**Calculation Logic**:
```solidity
// Example with 1000 USDC and weights [7000, 2000, 1000]
// Total fee weight: 10000 (100%)
// Treasury fee: 1000 * 7000 / 10000 = 700 USDC
// Team fee: 1000 * 2000 / 10000 = 200 USDC
// Marketing fee: 1000 * 1000 / 10000 = 100 USDC
// Adjusted amount: 1000 - (700 + 200 + 100) = 0 USDC
```

        // Temporarily set distribution token if different
        address currentToken = getCurrentDistributionToken();
        if (currentToken != token) {
            // Would need additional function to change distribution token
            // or handle multiple tokens in the fee distributor
        }
        
        IFeeDistributor(diamond).distributeAmounts(principalReceiver, amount);

contract FeeAnalytics {
    struct FeeReport {
        uint256 totalDistributed;
        uint256 totalFees;
        address[] recipients;
        uint256[] amounts;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }
    
    FeeReport[] public feeReports;
    
    function recordFeeDistribution(
        uint256 originalAmount,
        address principalReceiver
    ) external returns (uint256 reportId) {
        (
            address adjustedReceiver,

            originalAmount
        );
        
        uint256 totalFees = originalAmount - adjustedAmount;
        
        feeReports.push(FeeReport({
            totalDistributed: originalAmount,
            totalFees: totalFees,
            recipients: feeReceivers,
            amounts: feeAmounts,
            timestamp: block.timestamp
        }));
        
        return feeReports.length - 1;
    }
    
    function getFeeReport(uint256 reportId) external view returns (FeeReport memory) {
        require(reportId < feeReports.length, "Invalid report ID");
        return feeReports[reportId];
    }
}
```

## Events

### Configuration Events
```solidity
event FeeDistributorInitialized(address indexed distributionToken, uint256 totalWeightBasis);
event FeeReceiversSet(address[] receivers, uint256[] weights);
```

### Distribution Events
```solidity
event AmountsDistributed(
    address indexed principalReceiver,

- Optimized array operations

### Batch Operations
- Single transaction for all fee distributions
- Reduced gas costs compared to individual transfers
- Efficient event emission

## Error Handling

### Configuration Errors
- `"FeeDistributor: Distribution token cannot be zero address"` - Invalid token
- Array length mismatch errors
- Invalid weight configuration errors

### Distribution Errors
- Insufficient balance or allowance errors
- Transfer failure errors
- Invalid recipient address errors

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests
- Fee calculation accuracy
- Distribution execution
- Configuration validation
- Access control enforcement

### Integration Tests
- Marketplace integration
