# SDK Development Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for developing Software Development Kits (SDKs) and client libraries that interact with the Gemforce platform. Adhering to these guidelines ensures consistency, maintainability, and ease of use for developers integrating with Gemforce APIs and smart contracts.

## 1. Naming Conventions

*   **SDK Name**: SDKs should be clearly branded, typically featuring "Gemforce" and the primary language/platform (e.g., `Gemforce.js SDK`, `Gemforce Python SDK`).
*   **Module/Package Names**: Follow standard conventions for the target language (e.g., `gemforce-js`, `gemforce-python`).
*   **Class Names**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `GemforceClient`, `TradeDealManager`).
*   **Method Names**: Use camelCase for methods (e.g., `createTradeDeal`, `getCarbonCreditBalance`).
*   **Parameter Names**: Use camelCase (e.g., `tradeDealId`, `amountWei`).

## 2. API Interaction

*   **Consistent API Endpoints**: All SDKs must use the official Gemforce API endpoints.
*   **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms as specified by Gemforce (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens). Tokens should be handled securely and refreshed when necessary.
*   **Error Handling**: Provide robust error handling. Map API and smart contract error codes to meaningful SDK exceptions or error types. Include detailed error messages where possible.
*   **Rate Limiting**: SDKs should ideally include mechanisms to gracefully handle API rate limits (e.g., exponential backoff and retry logic).
*   **Pagination**: Implement helper methods for handling paginated API responses.

## 3. Smart Contract Interaction

*   **Wrapper Functions**: Provide convenient wrapper functions for common smart contract interactions (e.g., `mintNFT`, `transferCarbonCredit`).
*   **ABI Management**: Manage contract ABIs. Consider bundling them with the SDK or providing a mechanism to fetch them dynamically (though static bundling is often simpler for stability).
*   **Gas Estimation**: Implement reliable gas estimation for transactions before sending them.
*   **Transaction Status Monitoring**: Provide utilities to monitor the status of submitted blockchain transactions (pending, confirmed, failed).
*   **Wallet Integration**: Design for flexible wallet integration, supporting common wallet providers or mechanisms in the target environment (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).

## 4. Design Principles

*   **Modularity**: Design SDKs with modularity in mind. Separate concerns into logical components (e.g., `AuthService`, `TradeDealService`, `CarbonCreditService`).
*   **Simplicity**: Aim for a clear, intuitive, and easy-to-use API. Hide underlying complexities where possible.
*   **Extensibility**: Allow for easy extension or customization by developers who might need to interact with platform features not directly exposed by the SDK.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: All network and blockchain operations should be asynchronous to prevent blocking the application's main thread/loop.
*   **Immutability**: Prefer immutable data structures for inputs and outputs where appropriate.

## 5. Documentation and Examples

*   **README**: A comprehensive README.md in the SDK repository covering installation, quick start, and basic usage.
*   **API Reference**: Thorough API reference documentation for all classes, methods, and types. Leverage tools like JSDoc, Sphinx, or similar for auto-generating documentation.
*   **Code Examples**: Provide clear, concise, and runnable code examples for all major features and common use cases.
*   **Cookbooks/How-to Guides**: For more complex flows, provide step-by-step guides or "cookbooks."

## 6. Testing

*   **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for all SDK components.
*   **Integration Tests**: Integration tests that interact with live (or mock) Gemforce APIs and smart contracts.
*   **CI/CD**: Set up continuous integration for automated testing and deployment.

## 7. Versioning and Releases

*   **Semantic Versioning**: Follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for all SDK releases.
*   **Changelog**: Maintain a detailed `CHANGELOG.md` for each release, documenting new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes.
*   **Release Process**: Define a clear release process, including testing, documentation updates, and publication to relevant package managers (npm, pip, etc.).

## 8. Security Considerations

*   **Sensitive Data Handling**: Avoid logging or storing sensitive user data.
*   **Dependency Audits**: Regularly audit third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities.
*   **Input Validation**: Implement robust input validation to prevent common security flaws.

By adhering to these guidelines, Gemforce SDKs can provide a consistent, high-quality, and secure development experience for external integrators.
