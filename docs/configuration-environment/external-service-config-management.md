# External Service Configuration Management

The Gemforce platform integrates with various external services to provide its full range of functionalities, including secure key management (DFNS), email notifications (SendGrid), and data storage (IPFS/Pinata). Effective management of these external service configurations, particularly sensitive credentials, is paramount for security, reliability, and operational efficiency.

## 1. Principles of External Service Configuration

*   **Secure Credential Handling**: All API keys, secrets, private keys, and other credentials must be handled with the highest level of security.
*   **Environment Isolation**: Separate credentials for each environment (development, testnet, production) to limit the blast radius of a compromise.
*   **Least Privilege**: Configure external service permissions to grant only the necessary access required for Gemforce operations.
*   **Centralized Management**: Utilize secure, centralized secret management solutions.
*   **Auditing and Rotation**: Regularly audit access to credentials and implement rotation policies.

## 2. Types of External Services

### 2.1. Blockchain-Related Services

*   **RPC Providers (Infura, Alchemy, etc.)**: Used for interacting with blockchain networks (sending transactions, querying state).
    *   **Configuration**: API keys, project IDs, and endpoint URLs.
    *   **Management**: Typically managed in `gemforce.config.ts` or injected via environment variables. Production environments should use dedicated, rate-limited, and geographically distributed endpoints.
*   **Layer 2 Bridges/Oracles**: For cross-chain communication or bringing off-chain data on-chain.
    *   **Configuration**: Bridge contract addresses, API endpoints for oracle data feeds.
    *   **Management**: Smart contract configurations for bridge addresses. API keys for oracle data providers.

### 2.2. Security Services

*   **DFNS (Decentralized Financial Security)**: Multi-party computation (MPC) based key management and transaction signing.
    *   **Configuration**: API Key, Private Key (for authentication with DFNS), API URL, Wallet ID(s).
    *   **Management**: **Critical**: DFNS private keys and API keys must be securely stored (e.g., hardware security modules (HSMs), dedicated secret management services) and never exposed in code or standard environment variables in production.
*   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)**: For cryptographic operations, secure key storage.
    *   **Configuration**: Endpoint, authentication credentials.
    *   **Management**: Managed at the infrastructure level, often through cloud provider services or dedicated hardware.

### 2.3. Communication Services

*   **SendGrid (Email notifications)**: For sending transactional emails (e.g., user verification, password resets, trade deal updates).
    *   **Configuration**: API Key, Sender Email Address.
    *   **Management**: API keys should be restricted to sending emails from specific domains.
*   **Twilio (SMS, Voice - if applicable)**: For SMS or voice-based notifications.
    *   **Configuration**: Account SID, Auth Token.
    *   **Management**: Similar to SendGrid, adhere to least privilege.

### 2.4. Data Storage and Content Delivery

*   **IPFS/Pinata**: For decentralized file storage, particularly for NFT metadata.
    *   **Configuration**: Gateway URL, Pinata API Key, Pinata Secret API Key.
    *   **Management**: Keys need write access for pinning, read access for content retrieval. Consider using a dedicated pinning service and separate read/write API keys.
*   **Cloud Storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)**: For general-purpose file storage (e.g., backups, static assets).
    *   **Configuration**: Bucket names, access keys, region.
    *   **Management**: Implement strict bucket policies and IAM roles.

### 2.5. Financial Services

*   **Plaid (Bank linking - if applicable)**: For linking bank accounts for fiat on/off-ramps.
    *   **Configuration**: Client ID, Secret, Environment (Sandbox, Development, Production).
    *   **Management**: Follow Plaid's security best practices for token exchange and key management.
*   **Payment Gateways (Stripe, etc.)**: For processing fiat payments.
    *   **Configuration**: Publishable Key, Secret Key, Webhook Secrets.
    *   **Management**: Webhook secrets are critical for verifying incoming events.

## 3. Configuration Best Practices per Service Type

### 3.1. Secrets Management

*   **Use Cloud Native Secret Managers**: (AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault). These services provide secure storage, retrieval, and rotation of credentials.
*   **Environment Variables for Development/Test**: While convenient, only use `.env` files for non-production environments and never commit them to version col.
*   **Avoid Hardcoding**: Never hardcode any secrets directly in source code.
*   **Automated Injection**: Configure CI/CD pipelines and deployment processes to inject secrets into the runtime environment from the secret manager.

### 3.2. Access Control

*   **Dedicated Credentials**: Create unique API keys/credentials for each application or service that integrates with an external provider, rather than reusing a master key.
*   **Granular Permissions**: Restrict the permissions of each credential to only what is absolutely necessary. For example, an email API key should only have permission to send emails, not to modify account settings.
*   **IP Whitelisting**: If supported by the external service, whitelist the IP addresses from which Gemforce services will connect.

### 3.3. Monitoring and Alerting

*   **Monitor API Usage**: Track calls to external services for anomalies or excessive usage.
*   **Credential Expiration/Rotation**: Set up alerts for expiring credentials and automate their rotation where possible.
*   **Security Events**: Integrate security logs from external services into your centralized logging and monitoring system.

### 3.4. Redundancy and Fallback

*   **Multiple Providers**: For critical services (e.g., RPC providers), consider having multiple providers and implementing failover mechanisms.
*   **Caching**: Cache non-sensitive data from external services to reduce dependency and improve performance.

By rigorously applying these configuration management practices, Gemforce can ensure a secure, resilient, and manageable integration with its crucial external dependencies.
