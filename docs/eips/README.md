# Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) Extracted from Smart Contracts

This directory contains potential EIPs extracted from the smart contract codebase. Each EIP represents a standardized interface or pattern that could be valuable to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

## Overview

The following EIPs have been identified and documented based on the innovative patterns and interfaces found in the smart contracts:

## üìã EIP Summary

### 1. [Diamond-Enhanced NFT Marketplace](./EIP-DRAFT-Diamond-Enhanced-Marketplace.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Category**: Standards Track - ERC  
**Summary**: A standardized interface for NFT marketplaces built on the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) with configurable fee distribution, multiple payment methods, and identity-based access control.

**Key Features**:
- Configurable fee distribution to multiple receivers with parts-per-million precision
- Support for both ETH and ERC20 token payments
- Identity-based buyer verification through ERC734/ERC735 integration
- Price protection mechanisms and reentrancy protection
- Diamond Standard modularity for upgradeable marketplace functionality

### 2. [Multi-Token Sale Standard](./EIP-DRAFT-Multi-Token-Sale-Standard.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Category**: Standards Track - ERC  
**Summary**: A comprehensive standard for token sales supporting multiple token types (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155), multiple payment methods, and cryptographic proof-based purchases.

**Key Features**:
- Unified interface for ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 token sales
- Cryptographic proof-based purchases (Merkle proofs for allowlists)
- Support for ETH and ERC20 payments with automatic refunds
- Per-account purchase limits and quantity tracking
- Variable pricing mechanisms and batch operations

### 3. [Collateralized Trade Deal Standard](./EIP-DRAFT-Collateralized-Trade-Deal-Standard.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Category**: Standards Track - ERC  
**Summary**: A standardized interface for creating and managing collateralized trade deals that enable invoice financing through tokenized collateral and automated repayment mechanisms.

**Key Features**:
- Invoice NFTs as collateral for financing arrangements
- Tokenized collateral and interest distribution systems
- Multi-party funding with proportional token distribution
- Automated interest calculations and distributions
- Identity-based participation controls with claim requirements
- Multiple operation modes for different financing scenarios

### 4. [Enhanced Identity System](./EIP-DRAFT-Enhanced-Identity-System.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Category**: Standards Track - ERC  
**Summary**: An enhanced identity standard that extends ERC734/ERC735 with trusted issuer management, attribute-based access control, and integration capabilities for decentralized applications.

**Key Features**:
- Trusted issuer registry with claim topic authorization
- Attribute-based identity management with typed attributes
- Integration with smart contract systems for automated verification
- Claim topic-based access control for decentralized applications
- Verification status tracking and compliance features

---

### 5. [Diamond Factory Standard](./EIP-DRAFT-Diamond-Factory-Standard.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Category**: Standards Track - ERC  
**Summary**: A standardized factory pattern for deploying and managing Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) contracts with configurable facets, initialization parameters, and upgrade timelock mechanisms.

**Key Features**:
- Standardized Diamond deployment with configurable facet sets
- Template-based Diamond creation with predefined configurations
- Upgrade timelock initialization for security
- Event-driven deployment tracking and verification
- Integration with existing Diamond tooling and infrastructure

---

### 6. [Carbon Credit Standard](./EIP-DRAFT-Carbon-Credit-Standard.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Category**: Standards Track - ERC  
**Summary**: A comprehensive standard for tokenizing, trading, and retiring carbon credits and other environmental assets with full lifecycle tracking and verification.

**Key Features**:
- Tokenization of verified carbon credits as NFTs or fungible tokens
- Lifecycle tracking from issuance to retirement
- Integration with carbon registries and verification bodies
- Automated retirement and offset mechanisms
- Fractional ownership and trading capabilities
- Compliance with international carbon credit standards (VCS, CDM, Gold Standard)

## üîó Interconnections

These EIPs are designed to work together as part of a comprehensive ecosystem:

- **Diamond Standard Foundation**: The Diamond Factory enables deployment of upgradeable contracts that can implement the other standards as facets
- **Identity Integration**: The Enhanced Identity System provides access control for marketplaces, token sales, and trade deals
- **Financial Instruments**: The Trade Deal standard enables sophisticated financial products that can be traded on the marketplace
- **Environmental Assets**: The Carbon Credit standard enables trading of environmental assets through the marketplace infrastructure
- **Token Sales**: The Multi-Token Sale standard enables initial distribution of tokens used in other systems

## üìù Implementation Status

All EIPs include:
- ‚úÖ Complete interface specifications
- ‚úÖ Detailed rationale and motivation
- ‚úÖ Implementation examples and patterns
- ‚úÖ Security considerations
- ‚úÖ Reference to actual smart contract implementations
- ‚úÖ Test case requirements
- ‚úÖ Backwards compatibility analysis

## üöÄ Next Steps

To advance these EIPs:

1. **Community Review**: Share with the Ethereum community for feedback
2. **Reference Implementations**: Complete and audit the reference implementations
3. **Test Suites**: Develop comprehensive test suites for each standard
4. **Documentation**: Create developer guides and integration examples
5. **Formal Submission**: Submit to the EIP repository following the official process

## üìö Related Standards
