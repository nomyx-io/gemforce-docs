# EIP-DRAFT: Diamond-Enhanced NFT Marketplace with Fee Distribution

## Simple Summary

A standardized interface for NFT marketplaces built on the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) that supports configurable fee distribution, multiple payment methods, and identity-based access control.

## Abstract

This EIP proposes a standard interface for NFT marketplaces that leverages the Diamond Standard's modularity while providing advanced features including:
- Configurable fee distribution to multiple receivers
- Support for both ETH and ERC20 token payments
- Identity-based buyer verification
- Price protection mechanisms
- Reentrancy protection for all payment operations

## Motivation

Current NFT marketplace implementations often lack standardization and advanced features like flexible fee distribution and identity verification. This standard addresses these limitations by providing a comprehensive marketplace interface that can be implemented as a Diamond facet, enabling upgradeable and modular marketplace functionality.

## Specification

### Core Interface

```solidity
interface IEnhancedMarketplace {
    struct FeeReceiver {
        address receiver;
        uint256 sharePerMillion; // Parts per million (e.g., 10,000 = 1%)
    }
    
    struct MarketItem {
        address nftContract;
        uint256 tokenId;
        address seller;
        address owner;
        uint256 price;
        bool sold;
        address receiver;
        address paymentToken;
    }
    
    // Events
    event MarketplaceInitialized(FeeReceiver[] feeReceivers);
    event PaymentDistributed(address token, address receiver, uint256 amount);
    event Listings(address indexed nftContract, uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed seller, address receiver, address buyer, uint256 price, bool sold, address paymentToken);
    event Sales(address indexed nftContract, uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed buyer);
    event Delisted(uint256 indexed tokenId);
    
    // Core Functions
    function initializeMarketplace(FeeReceiver[] memory _feeReceivers) external;
    function listItem(address nftContract, address payable receiver, uint256 tokenId, uint256 price, bool transferNFT, address paymentToken) external payable;
    function purchaseItem(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, uint256 maxPrice) external payable;
    function delistItem(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function fetchItem(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId) external view returns (MarketItem memory);
    function fetchItems() external view returns (MarketItem[] memory);
    function getMarketplaceFeeReceivers() external view returns (FeeReceiver[] memory);
}
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Fee Distribution System
- Configurable fee receivers with parts-per-million precision
- Automatic distribution during purchases
- Support for both ETH and ERC20 payments
- Transparent fee tracking via events

#### 2. Payment Methods
- Native ETH payments
- ERC20 token payments
- Price protection with maximum acceptable price
- Automatic refund of excess ETH

#### 3. Identity Integration
- Buyer verification through identity registry
- Claim-based access control
- Trusted issuer validation

#### 4. Security Features
- Reentrancy protection on all payment functions
- Checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Ownership verification before listing

## Rationale

### Diamond Standard Integration
Using the Diamond Standard allows marketplaces to be upgradeable and modular, enabling new features to be added without disrupting existing functionality.

### Fee Distribution Precision
The parts-per-million system provides sufficient precision for fee calculations while remaining gas-efficient.

### Identity-Based Access Control
Integration with ERC734/ERC735 identity standards enables sophisticated access control and compliance features.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is designed to be compatible with existing ERC721 and ERC20 tokens. The Diamond Standard ensures that existing marketplace functionality can be preserved while adding new features.

## Implementation

### Reference Implementation

The reference implementation includes:
- [`MarketplaceFacet.sol`](../contracts/facets/MarketplaceFacet.sol) - Core marketplace functionality
- [`IMarketplace.sol`](../contracts/interfaces/IMarketplace.sol) - Interface definition
- [`IdentityStorage.sol`](../contracts/identity/IdentityStorage.sol) - Identity integration

### Gas Considerations

- Fee distribution adds minimal gas overhead
- Identity verification adds verification costs
- Diamond proxy adds small delegatecall overhead

## Security Considerations

1. **Reentrancy Protection**: All payment functions use the `nonReentrant` modifier
2. **Integer Overflow**: Uses SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ overflow protection
3. **Access Control**: Proper ownership verification before operations
4. **Payment Validation**: Validates payment amounts and methods
5. **Identity Verification**: Ensures buyers are registered in identity system

## Test Cases

Test cases should cover:
- Fee distribution accuracy
- Payment method handling
- Identity verification
- Reentrancy attack prevention
- Edge cases for price protection
