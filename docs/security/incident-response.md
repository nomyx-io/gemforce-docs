# Incident Response Procedures

This document outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents affecting the Gemforce platform. A well-defined incident response plan is crucial for minimizing damage, restoring services, learning from incidents, and maintaining trust with our users and stakeholders.

## 1. Incident Response Lifecycle

Our incident response process follows a phased approach:

### 1.1. Preparation

*   **Define Roles and Responsibilities**: Clearly assign roles (Incident Commander, Technical Leads, Communication Lead, Legal Counsel, etc.) and responsibilities within the incident response team.
*   **Establish Communication Channels**: Define internal (e.g., dedicated chat rooms, secure video conferencing) and external (e.g., public statements, customer support) communication protocols.
*   **Tools and Resources**: Ensure necessary tools (e.g., SIEM, forensic tools, secure remote access) and documented procedures are readily available.
*   **Training and Exercises**: Conduct regular training and simulated incident exercises (tabletop exercises, red team/blue team drills) to test the plan and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation for all systems, configurations, and incident response procedures.

### 1.2. Identification

*   **Detection Sources**: Monitor various sources for suspicious activity, including:
    *   Automated alerts from monitoring systems (e.g., SIEM, IDS/IPS, blockchain anomaly detection).
    *   User-reported anomalies or security concerns.
    *   Threat intelligence feeds.
    *   Internal security audits and penetration tests.
*   **Initial Triage**: Quickly assess the severity and potential impact of a reported incident. Determine if it's a false positive or a legitimate security event.
*   **Initial Containment**: Take immediate steps to prevent further damage (e.g., isolate affected systems, suspend compromised accounts, pause smart contract functions if necessary and safe to do so).
*   **Logging and Evidence Collection**: Ensure all relevant logs are being collected and preserved for forensic analysis. Do not alter any systems or data before proper evidence collection.

### 1.3. Containment

*   **Short-Term Containment**:
    *   Disconnect compromised systems from the network.
    *   Block malicious IP addresses at the firewall.
    *   Temporarily suspend or revoke compromised credentials.
    *   Redirect traffic away from affected services.
*   **Long-Term Containment**:
    *   Improve system configurations to prevent recurrence (e.g., patching vulnerabilities, reconfiguring access controls).
    *   Deploy updated security measures.

### 1.4. Eradication

*   **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the root cause of the incident. This involves detailed forensic analysis of compromised systems and logs.
*   **Eliminate Threats**: Remove the root cause of the incident (e.g., patch vulnerabilities, remove malware, re-secure compromised accounts, deploy updated smart contracts on new addresses if critical flaws are found).
*   **Clean Systems**: Ensure all compromised systems are thoroughly cleaned or rebuilt from known good states.

### 1.5. Recovery

*   **Verify Cleanliness**: Confirm that the threat has been completely eradicated from all systems.
*   **Restore Services**: Bring affected systems and services back online in a phased, controlled manner. Prioritize critical services first.
*   **Monitor Closely**: Continuously monitor restored systems for any signs of recurring activity.
*   **Post-Incident Validation**: Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure full functionality and security.

### 1.6. Post-Incident Activities (Lessons Learned)

*   **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Conduct a thorough review of the incident, including:
    *   What happened?
    *   How was it detected?
    *   How effective were the response actions?
    *   What was the root cause?
    *   What could have been done better?
*   **Documentation Update**: Update internal documentation, procedures, and runbooks based on lessons learned.
*   **Action Plan**: Create and implement an action plan for identified improvements (e.g., new security tools, process changes, additional training).
*   **Communication**: Communicate findings and actions to relevant internal and external stakeholders (e.g., executive team, concerned users, regulatory bodies if required).

## 2. Communication Plan

Effective communication is paramount during an incident:

*   **Internal Communication**:
    *   Activate the incident response team.
    *   Provide regular updates to management and relevant internal teams.
    *   Use secure and predefined communication channels.
*   **External Communication**:
    *   **Transparency First**: Be transparent with users and the public about the incident, providing accurate and timely information.
    *   **Designated Spokesperson**: All external communications should come from a single, designated spokesperson.
    *   **Timing**: Balance speed of communication with accuracy; do not speculate.
    *   **Channels**: Utilize appropriate channels (e.g., official website, social media, email notifications).
    *   **Legal/Regulatory**: Consult legal counsel for advice on mandatory disclosures or regulatory reporting requirements.

## 3. Incident Severity Levels

Incidents are categorized based on their impact and urgency to prioritize response:

| Level      | Impact                                                               | Example                                                                                                     | Response Urgency                                                         |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Major financial loss, significant data breach, core service outage, reputation collapse. | Exploit drains funds from a smart contract; database containing all user data is compromised.               | Immediate, 24/7 activation of full response team.                        |
| **High**     | Moderate financial loss, partial service degradation, regulatory non-compliance. | DDoS attack affecting some API endpoints; minor data exposure (e.g., employee email list).                  | Urgent, response team activated within minutes, work around the clock. |
| **Medium**   | Minor financial impact, temporary service interruption, isolated security breach. | Server compromise with limited access; internal application vulnerability detected.                         | Standard business hours response, but with high priority.                |
| **Low**      | Negligible impact, minor security flaw, policy violation.            | Suspicious login attempt (blocked); non-critical security tool misconfiguration.                            | Document and resolve during regular operations.                          |
