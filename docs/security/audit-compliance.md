# Security Audits and Compliance

This document outlines the Gemforce platform's approach to formal security audits, internal reviews, and adherence to relevant compliance standards. Maintaining a high level of security assurance is critical for a blockchain-based platform dealing with digital assets and sensitive identity data.

## 1. Smart Contract Security Audits

Formal security audits by independent third-party firms are a cornerstone of our smart contract security strategy.

### 1.1. Audit Scope and Process

*   **Initial Audits**: All core smart contracts, especially those handling value transfer, access control, or critical business logic (e.g., Diamond, Marketplace, TradeDeal, Minter facets), undergo comprehensive audits *before* initial deployment to mainnet environments.
*   **Re-Audits**: Significant changes to existing contracts (e.g., introduction of new facets, major upgrades) or the addition of highly sensitive functionalities trigger mandatory re-audits.
*   **Continuous Review**: Even between formal audits, developers regularly review code, conduct internal peer reviews, and leverage automated analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Scope Definition**: Each audit begins with a clearly defined scope, outlining the specific contracts, functionalities, and threat models to be covered.
*   **Methodology**: Auditors typically employ a combination of static analysis, dynamic analysis, manual code review, and penetration testing techniques.
*   **Reporting**: Detailed reports are generated, categorizing findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low), providing clear explanations, and suggesting remediation steps.

### 1.2. Chosen Audit Firms

We engage reputable blockchain security audit firms known for their expertise in Solidity, EVM, and decentralized finance (DeFi) security.
*   *Specific firm names will be disclosed publicly following successful audits and team approval.*

### 1.3. Remediation and Verification

*   All findings from security audits are treated with high priority.
*   Critical and High-severity findings are addressed immediately.
*   Remediations are thoroughly tested by our internal QA and development teams.
*   For Critical and High-severity findings, follow-up verification by the auditing firm is requested to confirm vulnerabilities have been successfully mitigated.

## 2. Platform (Application & Infrastructure) Security Assessments

Beyond smart contracts, the Gemforce platform's cloud infrastructure, application logic (cloud functions, APIs), and data pipelines also undergo regular security scrutiny.

*   **Penetration Testing**: Annual or bi-annual penetration tests conducted by external security firms to simulate real-world attacks against our deployed systems.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning**: Continuous automated vulnerability scanning of our web applications, cloud environments, and network infrastructure.
*   **Configuration Audits**: Regular reviews of cloud service configurations (e.g., AWS Security Hub, GCP Security Command Center alerts) to ensure adherence to security best practices and compliance frameworks.
*   **Dependency Scanning**: Automated tools monitor third-party libraries and dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `npm audit`, `pip audit`, Snyk, Dependabot).

## 3. Compliance and Regulatory Adherence

Gemforce is committed to complying with relevant industry standards and regulatory requirements. Our compliance efforts include:

*   **Data Protection**: Adhering to global data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) for handling personal user data.
*   **KYC/AML Integration**: Leveraging industry-standard Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solutions to ensure compliance in financial transactions and identity verification.
*   **Blockchain-Specific Regulations**: Monitoring and adapting to evolving blockchain and digital asset regulations in relevant jurisdictions.
*   **Internal Controls**: Implementing strong internal controls to ensure segregation of duties, prevent fraud, and maintain data integrity.
*   **Record Keeping**: Maintaining comprehensive records of security incidents, audit reports, and compliance attestations.

## 4. Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We operate a responsible disclosure program and encourage security researchers to report any discovered vulnerabilities.

*   **Contact**: Please refer to our official website or `security.txt` file for the preferred method of contacting our security team (e.g., dedicated security email, bug bounty platform).
*   **Information Required**: When reporting, please provide detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, its potential impact, and any proof-of-concept code.
*   **Acknowledgement**: We commit to acknowledging receipt of your report promptly and providing regular updates on our progress.
