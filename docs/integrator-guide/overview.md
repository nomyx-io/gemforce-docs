# Integrator's Guide: Overview

Welcome to the Gemforce Integrator's Guide! This document provides a comprehensive overview for developers looking to integrate with the Gemforce platform. Whether you're building a new dApp, extending existing systems, or simply want to interact with Gemforce's smart contracts and cloud functions, this guide will walk you through the essential steps and concepts.

Gemforce is a robust blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications, focusing on digital asset management, carbon credits, trade deals, and identity solutions. It leverages the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) for modular smart contract architecture and a powerful cloud functions layer for off-chain capabilities.

This guide is structured to help you understand various integration points and best practices:

1.  **Authentication**: How to authenticate your applications and users with the Gemforce platform and its underlying services.
2.  **REST API**: Interacting with Gemforce's core functionalities via its RESTful API endpoints.
3.  **Smart Contracts**: Direct interaction with Gemforce's on-chain logic, including Diamond contracts, facets, and libraries.
4.  **DFNS Integration**: Leveraging DFNS Wallet-as-a-Service for secure key management and transaction signing.
5.  **Webhooks**: Receiving real-time notifications about events occurring on the Gemforce platform.
6.  **Error Handling**: Understanding and effectively handling errors across different integration layers.
7.  **Sample Code**: Practical code examples to jumpstart your development.
8.  **Integration Patterns**: Recommended architectural patterns for common integration scenarios.
9.  **Testing**: Strategies and tools for thorough testing of your integrations.
10. **Security**: Best practices for securing your integrated applications.
11. **Compliance**: Guidance on regulatory and compliance considerations.

## Key Concepts to Understand

Before diving into specific integration details, it's beneficial to grasp these core Gemforce concepts:

-   **Diamond Standard (EIP-2535)**: Gemforce's smart contracts are built using the Diamond Standard. This means functionalities are separated into "facets" which are attached to a central "Diamond" contract. This modularity allows for upgrades and extensions without redeploying the entire contract.
    -   **Learn more**: [Diamond Standard Overview](../smart-contracts/diamond.md)
-   **Cloud Functions (Parse Server)**: Many of Gemforce's advanced features and user-facing functionalities are exposed through a cloud functions layer powered by Parse Server. This provides a traditional API interface for interacting with blockchain functionalities, managing user data, and handling complex business logic off-chain.
    -   **Learn more**: [Cloud Functions Overview](../cloud-functions/index.md)
-   **Multi-Network Support**: Gemforce supports multiple blockchain networks (e.g., Base Sepolia, Optimism Sepolia, Sepolia). Your integration should be designed to handle multi-network considerations.
-   **Identity System (ERC-734/ERC-735)**: Gemforce incorporates a robust identity management system based on ERC-734 (Key Manager) and ERC-735 (Claim Holder) for verifiable credentials and decentralized identity.
    -   **Learn more**: [IIdentity Interface](../smart-contracts/interfaces/iidentity.md)
-   **Key Technical Concepts**: Familiarize yourself with Gemforce's core features like Carbon Credit Management, Trade Deal System, Multi-Token Sales, and SVG Templating, as these will likely be areas of integration.
    -   **Learn more**: [System Architecture](../system-architecture/gemforce-system-architecture.md)

## Getting Started

To ensure a smooth integration process, we recommend the following initial steps:

1.  **Review the System Architecture**: Gain a high-level understanding of how Gemforce components interact.
2.  **Set up Your Development Environment**: Follow the [Developer Setup Guide](../developer-setup-guide.md) to prepare your local machine.
3.  **Explore Core API Endpoints**: Begin by understanding the basic authentication and data retrieval methods described in the [REST API](rest-api.md) section.
4.  **Examine Sample Code**: Look at the provided [Sample Code](sample-code.md) to see practical implementations across different integration types.
