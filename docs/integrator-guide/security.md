# Integrator's Guide: Security

Security is paramount when integrating with the Gemforce platform, especially given its blockchain-centric nature and the handling of sensitive digital assets. This guide outlines key security considerations, best practices, and common vulnerabilities to help you build secure and resilient applications.

## Overview of Gemforce Security

Gemforce's security posture is multi-layered, encompassing:

-   **Smart Contract Security**: Audited contracts, adherence to secure coding standards.
-   **Cloud Function Security**: Parse Server's built-in security features, secure API key management, robust access control.
-   **DFNS Integration**: MPC-based key management for enhanced cryptographic security.
-   **Platform Operations**: Secure deployment, monitoring, and incident response procedures.

As an integrator, your application forms a critical link in this security chain.

## 1. Secure Smart Contract Interaction

Direct interaction with blockchain smart contracts requires meticulous attention to security.

### Common Vulnerabilities

-   **Reentrancy**: A common attack where a malicious contract repeatedly calls back into a vulnerable contract before the first function call is complete.
-   **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Arithmetical operations exceeding the maximum or minimum size of their data type, leading to unexpected values.
-   **Access Control Issues**: Functions critical for contract state are not properly permissioned, allowing unauthorized users to execute them.
-   **Front-Running**: An attacker observes a pending advantageous transaction and submits their own transaction with higher gas fees to execute before it.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Attacks preventing legitimate users from accessing services, often by exhausting gas or blocking state changes.
-   **Delegatecall Vulnerabilities**: Incorrect usage of `delegatecall` can lead to storage collision or unauthorized code execution.
-   **Unchecked External Calls**: Naively calling external contracts without proper checks (e.g., for reentrancy guards).

### Best Practices

-   **Use Audited Contracts**: Always use official, audited Gemforce smart contracts. Do not deploy or use modified versions without independent security review.
-   **Least Privilege**: Grant only the necessary permissions to smart contract addresses that your application interacts with.
-   **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs from users before sending them to smart contracts. Even though smart contracts should also validate, client-side/backend validation adds another layer of defense.
-   **Secure Transaction Signing**:
    -   **Never expose private keys**: Handle private keys only in secure, controlled environments (e.g., hardware wallets, dedicated backend services like DFNS).
    -   **DFNS Integration**: Leverage DFNS for secure, policy-driven transaction signing where possible.
    -   **"Blind Signing"**: Educate users about what they are signing. Implement clear transaction details for user confirmation.
-   **Gas Management**: Properly estimate and manage gas limits to avoid transaction failures (and potential DoS) or excessive costs.
-   **Monitor Events/State**: Actively monitor for unusual activity by tracking smart contract events and state changes.
-   **Emergency Stop/Pause**: Understand and utilize emergency stop mechanisms if provided in Gemforce's smart contracts to mitigate ongoing attacks.
-   **Upgradability**: While Gemforce Diamonds are upgradeable, understand that upgrades themselves pose security risks if not managed properly. Monitor upgrade announcements.

## 2. Secure API and Cloud Function Integration

Gemforce's Parse Server backend and Cloud Functions are critical components.

### Common Vulnerabilities

-   **API Key Exposure**: Hardcoding or publicly exposing API keys.
-   **Insecure Data Transmission**: Using HTTP instead of HTTPS.
-   **Weak Authentication**: Guessable passwords, lack of multi-factor authentication.
-   **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection (if using raw queries), NoSQL injection, command injection.
-   **Broken Access Control**: Improperly configured ACLs/CLPs allowing unauthorized access to data or functions.
-   **Rate Limiting Abuse**: Lack of rate limiting on API endpoints leading to DoS or brute-force attacks.
-   **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Logging sensitive information or returning it in API responses.

### Best Practices

-   **HTTPS Everywhere**: Always use HTTPS for all communications with Gemforce's REST API and Cloud Functions to encrypt data in transit.
-   **Secure API Key Management**:
    -   Use environment variables or a secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) for `Master Key` and other sensitive API keys.
    -   Never hardcode API keys directly into client-side code unless explicitly designed for public consumption (e.g., `X-Parse-Client-Key` for public data).
-   **User Authentication**: Implement strong password policies, encourage/enforce MFA, and securely manage user sessions.
-   **Input Validation**: Implement comprehensive server-side input validation for all data received from clients to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
-   **Access Control**: Rigorously configure and review Parse Server's built-in [ACLs (Access Control Lists)](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#acls-and-class-level-permissions) and [CLPs (Class Level Permissions)](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#class-level-permissions) to restrict data access only to authorized users/roles.
-   **Error Handling**: Avoid verbose error messages in production that could leak sensitive information (e.g., stack traces).
-   **Rate Limiting**: Implement application-level rate limiting on your API calls to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
-   **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement detailed logging for API requests and responses, and monitor for suspicious activity.

## 3. General Application Security

These practices apply to your integrating application as a whole.

### Best Practices

-   **Minimal Dependencies**: Use only necessary third-party libraries and keep them updated to minimize attack surface. Regularly audit your dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
-   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure that all components (applications, services, users) operate with the minimum set of permissions necessary to perform their function.
-   **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)**: Incorporate security considerations at every stage of your development process, from design to deployment and maintenance.
-   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing**: Periodically engage security professionals to audit your entire integrated application for vulnerabilities.
-   **Incident Response Plan**: Have a clear plan for identifying, responding to, and recovering from security incidents. This includes communication strategy, data breach procedures, and recovery steps.
-   **Data Protection**: Ensure sensitive user data (e.g., email addresses, personal identifiers) is stored and transmitted securely, ideally encrypted at rest and in transit.
-   **Code Review**: Implement mandatory code reviews covering security aspects.
-   **Employee Training**: Train your development and operations teams on secure coding practices and security awareness.
