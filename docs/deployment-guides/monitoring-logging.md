# Deployment Guides: Monitoring and Logging

Effective monitoring and logging are essential for maintaining the health, performance, and security of your Gemforce-powered applications in production. This guide outlines strategies for collecting, analyzing, and acting upon operational data from your smart contracts, cloud functions, and underlying infrastructure.

## Overview

A comprehensive monitoring and logging strategy involves:

-   **Log Collection**: Centralizing logs from all application components.
-   **Metric Collection**: Gathering performance and health metrics.
-   **Dashboarding**: Visualizing key metrics and trends.
-   **Alerting**: Notifying teams of critical issues.
-   **Event Monitoring**: Tracking on-chain activities.

## 1. Log Management

Logs provide detailed records of events and operations within your application and infrastructure.

### Best Practices

-   **Centralized Logging**: Consolidate logs from all sources (Parse Server, Cloud Functions, smart contract listeners, web servers, databases) into a centralized logging platform (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; Splunk; Datadog; Sumo Logic; AWS CloudWatch Logs).
-   **Structured Logging**: Output logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to make them easily parsable and queryable.
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-06-26T10:00:00Z",
      "level": "INFO",
      "service": "cloud-function-user-auth",
      "functionName": "login",
      "userId": "user123_parse_id",
      "message": "User logged in successfully",
      "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
      "durationMs": 50
    }
    ```
-   **Logging Levels**: Use appropriate logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) and adjust them for production environments to reduce noise and overhead (e.g., typically INFO or WARN for production).
-   **Contextual Logging**: Include relevant contextual information in your logs (e.g., `userId`, `transactionId`, `requestId`) to make debugging easier.
-   **Sensitive Data Redaction**: **Never log sensitive information** (private keys, API keys, personal identifiable information like raw passwords). Redact or mask such data before logging.
-   **Log Retention**: Define and enforce log retention policies based on compliance requirements and debugging needs.

## 2. Metrics and Performance Monitoring

Metrics provide quantifiable data points about the behavior and performance of your system.

### Best Practices

-   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Define KPIs for each layer:
    -   **Backend/Cloud Functions**: API response times (latency), request rates, error rates, CPU/memory utilization, concurrent users, Cloud Function execution duration, database query performance.
    -   **Smart Contracts**: Gas costs per transaction, transaction confirmation times, transaction volume, active users per contract, event emission rates.
    -   **Infrastructure**: Server health (CPU, RAM, disk I/O, network throughput), database connections, network latency.
-   **Monitoring Tools**: Utilize dedicated monitoring platforms (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring).
-   **Custom Metrics**: Instrument your Cloud Functions and backend code to emit custom metrics for business-specific logic or critical workflows.
-   **Distributed Tracing**: For complex microservices architectures, implement distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin) to visualize the flow of requests across multiple services.
-   **Uptime Monitoring**: External tools to ensure your public endpoints are always reachable.

## 3. Dashboarding

Dashboards provide a visual overview of your system's health and performance.

### Best Practices

-   **Role-Based Dashboards**: Create specialized dashboards for different teams (e.g., operations, developers, business analysts), showing metrics relevant to their roles.
-   **Real-time & Historical**: Combine real-time data for immediate issue detection with historical trends for capacity planning and root cause analysis.
-   **Key Metrics First**: Prioritize the most critical KPIs prominently.
-   **Alerting Integration**: Link dashboard visualizations directly to your alerting system.

## 4. Alerting

Alerts notify personnel when critical events or thresholds are crossed, enabling rapid response to issues.

### Best Practices

-   **Define Clear Thresholds**: Set actionable thresholds for metrics (e.g., "error rate > 5% for 5 minutes").
-   **Actionable Alerts**: Ensure alerts contain sufficient context (what, where, when, why) to enable quick diagnosis and resolution.
-   **Severity Levels**: Categorize alerts by severity (e.g., informational, warning, critical) and configure notification channels accordingly (e.g., Slack, email, PagerDuty).
-   **Avoid Alert Fatigue**: Too many alerts lead to ignored alerts. Focus on alerting for actual problems, not symptoms. Use alert deduplication and suppress non-critical noisy alerts.
-   **Runbooks**: Link alerts to runbooks or troubleshooting guides that provide step-by-step instructions for resolving common issues.
-   **Test Alerts**: Periodically test your alerting system to ensure it functions correctly.

## 5. Blockchain Event Monitoring

Beyond traditional infrastructure, monitoring on-chain events is crucial for Gemforce applications.

### Best Practices

-   **Event Listeners**: Deploy dedicated services that listen for smart contract events (e.g., `ItemListed`, `TradeDealCreated`, `DiamondCut`, `Transfer`).
-   **Event Indexing**: Store processed events in your Parse Server database or a dedicated data warehouse for querying and analysis.
-   **Tools**: Utilize services like The Graph, Dune Analytics, or roll your own event indexing service using tools like `ethers.js` or `web3.js` connected to an RPC provider.
-   **Fraud Detection**: Monitor event streams for unusual patterns or anomalies that might indicate fraudulent activity.
